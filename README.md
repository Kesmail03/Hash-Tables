To run this program, pull all files to your local machine. Then run the following command

./a.out

This program allows the user to enter in what animal they have and to also input key characteristics about their animal. Things like the breed of the animal their size, how long they've had them and many more. To store all of this data I used a hash table and the resolution technique I used was chaining. I also used an external data file to allow the user to instantly add information about animals without having to type it in themselves. I implemented an add, load, display by keyword, retrieve keyword, display by personality and display all function.
